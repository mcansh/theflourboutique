<a href="/" class="back-to-home">Back to home</a><p style="display:block">Under the Michigan Cottage Law, I cannot ship out cookies. I am going to be looking into renting a commercial kitchen but until then, they have to be hand delivered or picked up from my home. I will deliver for free within a 5 mile radius. Anything over 5 miles is $1.00 per mile over. Example: if you live 10 miles from me, I would charge you $5 to deliver then another $5 to my home, so your charge would be $10 for delivery. My location is Shelby Twp., Michigan. If you have any questions <a href="{{ site.email }}">email me</a>.</p>
