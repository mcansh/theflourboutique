[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mcansh/theflourboutique.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Needed a form to send an email when there was a new order, accomplished this, plus got to play with node.

## Set up
1. clone the repo
2. install dependencies `$ yarn` or `$ npm install`
3. make a `variables.env` file with `NODE_ENV`, `DATABASE`, `MAP_KEY` variables.
4. `$ yarn dev` or `$ npm run dev`
